Trying to create a module for tizenbrew with downdog yoga website.

When using this module, try to load it via:
github modules ->
 fire-breath/DownDogTB@main220

# Usable
- Not perfect UI navigation, but for my skills with javascript it is good than enough :D
- Only use the main screen with login/sign up to only login  with email and password
- You can select main menu options for yoga settings (account settings etc may not fully work)
- You can navigate on a player, but it is not perfect, to show UI go down, to hide to go fully up (you can essentially stop/pasue and change the quality to HD), those like dislike buttons works

If I will be bored I will try to make it better, but for now you can use it quite well.
